# RAATD

The Retrospective Analysis of Antarctic Tracking Data (RAATD) is a SCAR project, also endorsed by the [Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR)](https://www.ccamlr.org/). It is an effort of the SCAR Expert Groups on [Birds and Marine Mammals](https://www.scar.org/science/eg-bamm/) and [Antarctic Biodiversity Informatics](https://www.scar.org/science/egabi/abi/).

This repository will contain code and other goodies from the project.
